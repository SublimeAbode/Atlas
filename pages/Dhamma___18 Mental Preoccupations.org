* In [[https://suttacentral.net/mn137/en/sujato?lang=en][MN 137]], the Buddha defines 18 mental preoccupations with feeling:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
'The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it? 
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
Hearing a sound with the ear … 
Smelling an odor with the nose … 
Tasting a flavor with the tongue … 
Feeling a touch with the body … 
Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity. So there are six preoccupations with *happiness*, six preoccupations with *sadness*, and six preoccupations with *equanimity*. (Sujato)

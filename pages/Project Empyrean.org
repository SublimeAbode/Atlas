** In other words, answers to the question, "What should I do to be happy forever?"
*
* In pursuit of this goal, Project Empyrean was formed as a nonprofit[fn:1] research organization to coordinate both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research#Original_research][primary]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_research][secondary]] research in this field, with the ultimate goal of producing [[Maps][maps]] of reality and derivative constructs by which volition may be optimally constrained.

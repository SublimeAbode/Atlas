* Insofar as [[Terms/Happiness][happiness]] is governed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality][causality]] within influence of [[Terms/Volition][volition]], Project Empyrean seeks maximally [[Certainty][certain]] [[Terms/Information][information]] and derivative [[Terms/Solution][solutions]] by which volition may be constrained for the indefinite minimization of [[Terms/Stress][stress]] below a [[Terms/Threshold][threshold]]. In other words, "What should I do to be happy forever, and how can I make sure it actually happens?"

* To better coordinate these efforts, Project Empyrean was formed as a nonprofit[fn:1] research organization currently focusing on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research#Original_research][primary]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_research][secondary]] research for the consolidation of information into maps of reality by which volition may be constrained.

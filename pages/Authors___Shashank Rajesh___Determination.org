* It is beneficial to cultivate the faculty of willpower and determination, which can serve as a powerful force for both productivity as well as certainty.
* Whenever a determination is made, e.g. "I will accomplish X by 12PM", it /must/ be completed successfully.
* Do not make any determinations which you are not certain to accomplish.
* A modification clause can serve as a way to change one's determination only after significant deliberation, e.g. "This determination may only be changed after 30 minutes of contemplation every day for three consecutive days."

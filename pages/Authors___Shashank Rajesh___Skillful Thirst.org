* Skillfully exploiting one's desires can be effective in accelerating progress.
* Too much and one is overcome with thirst, too little and one loses interest. The goal is to maximize the tension without collapsing.

** Karmic balances and long term investments to keep money inaccessible.
* Two kinds of thirst: human and [[Shashank Rajesh/Productive Heaven][heavenly]].

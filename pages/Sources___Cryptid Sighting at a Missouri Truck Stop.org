Bob Gimlin presents a 2022 viewer submission recounting a cryptid sighting from 1995 when the submitter was 12 years old. While on a summer camp field trip, during a bus stop at a rest area in Newberg, Phelps County, Missouri, the boy saw a non-human, bipedal creature peering from behind a tree less than 50 feet away. He described its face as:

*   Extremely disturbing, smooth, and hairless, almost like porcelain.
*   "Not quite ripened peach" in color (yellowy-beige) with bizarre deep purple-red splotches that tapered off across its face.
*   Small, closed mouth with a long crease.
*   Receded hairline with "peach fuzz" on top of its head, a completely smooth and shiny forehead.
*   Elongated or ovular head shape.
*   Round nose with slit-like, trench-like nostrils.
*   A smooth, raised, gracefully recurved brow ridge above forward-set eyes.

The witness immediately knew it was not human and only glimpsed its deer-colored, upright body as it dashed into the trees. Another camper, an Asian girl, also saw the creature and, despite her typically quiet demeanor, appeared alarmed but unsurprised, which the submitter found unsettling. Years later, the submitter was shocked to find the creature's face strikingly similar to an orc he saw in *Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*. He considers this event a "core memory," shaping his understanding of: pure, instinctual fear; the existence of inexplicable phenomena; and a profound sense of shared experience and quiet trust with the other witness. The submitter uniquely feels it was "not his sighting" but primarily the girl's, suggesting she might have a deeper or ongoing connection to such entities. Gimlin comments on the difficulty of eyewitness descriptions, the location's eerie history, and the importance of documenting diverse cryptid encounters, expressing unease with the "not my sighting" theory.

This is what I found it could of been a "Dokkebi" or a "San Dokkebi" which in Korean Foklore is a "Mountain Spirit with Doll like goblin faces". The are said to peek behind trees, bushes and rocks near the tree line and instill fear in those who see them. Also there is a phrase that translates to "If someone sees a Dokkebi, they shut their mouth" in fear of attracting their attention, ironically this lines up with Native American folklore about the hairy man. If you talk about it it comes around so they say

*** TODO What is the precise causal relationship between [[Terms/Sensation][sensation]], [[Terms/Perception][perception]], [[Terms/Feeling][feeling]], and the final experience of [[Terms/Stress][stress]]?
*** TODO How can [[Cognitive Reframing]] reliably and permanently alter the perception of displeasurable sensations into neutral or pleasurable ones?
*** TODO To what extent can the process of [[Terms/Binding][binding]] be controlled or ceased entirely in the presence of intense [[Terms/Feeling][feeling]]?
*** TODO Can we define a minimal set of [[Requisites of Happiness]] necessary to keep [[Terms/Stress][stress]] below a [[Terms/Threshold][threshold]] for a human being?
*** TODO What is the fundamental nature of [[Terms/Consciousness][consciousness]]—is it purely emergent from the physical brain, or is there an irreducible, non-physical component?
*** TODO What is the physical substrate (if any) of mental phenomena like [[Terms/Volition][volition]], [[Terms/Perception][perception]], and [[Terms/Identity][identity]] that persists through rebirth?
** Causality, Volition, and Merit
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO What is the precise mechanism by which [[Terms/Volition][volition]] and [[Terms/Formation][formation]] influence long-term causal outcomes (i.e., [[Karma as an Approximation][karma]])?
*** TODO Can the "karmic" outcomes of current actions be measured or predicted empirically, possibly using physical technology like brain scanning? (See [[Measuring Karma]])
*** TODO How can an agent reliably maintain a "wise" practice—one that is [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Four Kinds of Practice][pleasant now and results in future pleasure]]—indefinitely?
*** TODO How can one's mental paradigms and acquired knowledge be [[Persisting Mental Paradigms Throughout Existences][persisted indefinitely]] across changes in existence (e.g., rebirth)?
** Transcendence and Superior Existence
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Is [[Terms/Freedom][Freedom]] (Nibbana) an irreversible neurological adaptation, an unfathomably long conditioned state, or a metaphysical breakthrough?
*** TODO How can a superior, non-human existence (e.g., [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Productive Heaven][Productive Heaven]]) be designed, defined, and achieved by [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Rebirth By Choice][choice]]?
*** TODO Can we develop [[External Verification of Perfection][external, empirical tests]] to verify the attainment of advanced contemplative states, such as the complete cessation of mental suffering (Arahantship)? (See also [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Testing Arahants][Testing Arahants]])
*** TODO What is the role of self-transcendent states (e.g., Jhanas, psychedelics, flow states) in permanently restructuring the brain's reactivity to [[Terms/Displeasure][displeasure]]?
*** TODO To what degree can the Buddhist concept of [[Dhamma/18 Mental Preoccupations][18 Mental Preoccupations]] be correlated with modern neuroscientific models of sensory processing and emotion?
*** TODO What are the most efficient means for generating *merit* to ensure a superior rebirth, as discussed in [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Prospectus][Prospectus]]?
** Applied Technology and Solutions
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Is it technologically feasible to create an [[Creating an Enlightenment Pill][Enlightenment Pill]] or BCI device that configures the body/mind state to be extremely conducive to liberation?
*** TODO How can an [[Authors/Shashank Rajesh/Protocol Driven AI Decision Making][AI decision-making engine]] be constructed based on the [[Maps]] to constrain volition optimally in real-time?
*** TODO What is the optimal strategy for intelligently pursuing ethical goals, given the possibility of [[Eternal Oblivion Practically Nullifies all Ethical Pursuits][eternal oblivion]]?
*** TODO What are the ethical implications and safety protocols for using advanced technology (BCI, genetic engineering, psychoactives) to achieve [[Creating an Enlightenment Pill][contemplative goals]]?
*** TODO What are the prerequisites and design principles for a [[Transmortal Personal Computing][transmortal computing system]] accessible to the mind regardless of its bodily vessel?
*** TODO How can we leverage modern scientific understanding of pain (nociception vs. perception) to design new forms of [[Terms/Solution][solutions]] for stress management?

** Current Scientific Consensus (Fact)
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Define and delineate sentience, [[Terms/Consciousness][consciousness]], and sapience in a research context, citing primary scientific definitions.
*** TODO Systematically review neurological, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence for pain perception and subjective experience in non-human animals (mammals, birds, cephalopods, fish, insects).
*** TODO Investigate leading theories on the physical correlates of consciousness (e.g., nervous system complexity, global workspace theory, predictive processing) and their applicability to non-human brains.
*** TODO Research the current state of knowledge regarding self-recognition (e.g., mirror test) and theory of mind (e.g., understanding intention) in non-human species.
*** TODO Evaluate how findings from animal sentience research (e.g., the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness) impact ethical guidelines and legal frameworks.
** Theoretical and Philosophical Perspectives
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Explore philosophical models (e.g., Idealism, Dualism, Panpsychism, Integrated Information Theory, Orchestrated Objective Reduction) concerning the nature and distribution of non-biological or pervasive [[Terms/Consciousness][consciousness]].
*** TODO Analyze the ethical implications of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the criteria required to grant it moral status and legal rights.
*** TODO Investigate the concept of "Group Sentience" or "Collective Consciousness" in complex systems like ant colonies, fungal networks, or planetary ecosystems.
*** TODO Research the philosophical and theoretical constraints on designing and defining a superior, non-human existence (e.g., the potential for non-sensory experience).
*** TODO Evaluate arguments for and against the possibility of "super-sentience" or cognitive capacities fundamentally beyond human comprehension.
** Historical and Contemplative Context (Historical Conjecture)
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Conduct a comparative survey of non-materialist, cosmological models of existence (e.g., realms in Buddhism/Hinduism, planes of existence in Gnosticism) and their detailed descriptions of non-human beings (e.g., devas, asuras, pretas, nature spirits).
*** TODO Systematically collect and analyze historical claims and accounts of verifiable interaction with non-human beings (e.g., monks witnessing devas, traditional accounts of spiritual testing).
*** TODO Research how non-human beings are classified and described in these texts regarding their capacity for [[Terms/Suffering][suffering]], [[Terms/Happiness][happiness]], and the potential for moral [[Terms/Volition][volition]].
*** TODO Investigate the concept of *tulpas* or magically/mentally created entities and their supposed subjective reality or influence.
** Anomalous Experiential Reports
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
*** TODO Systematically catalog and analyze a diverse range of modern experiential reports of non-human beings (e.g., DMT/psychedelic entities, near-death experience beings, UAPs/aliens, ghosts, cryptids, men in black, shapeshifters, reptilians).
*** TODO Critically assess methodologies for recording and verifying consistency in anomalous reports (e.g., UFO databases, CE-5 protocols, psychic validation efforts).
*** TODO Investigate potential psychological, neurochemical (e.g., temporal lobe activity), and cultural priming explanations for these experiences, while maintaining that the subjective experience itself is genuine.
*** TODO Research the relationship between anomalous phenomena and consciousness manipulation (e.g., how UFO sightings often occur around energy fields or specific psychological states).
*** TODO Analyze the cultural and historical persistence of specific anomalous entities (e.g., "The Fae" vs. modern alien abduction narratives).

* Human existence is totally inadequate for any [[Sensual Enjoyment]] worthy of pursuing.
* It doesn't matter how good technology gets; we are ultimately bound by this loathsome body of flesh and bones which places all sorts of limitations on sensual enjoyment.
* True sensuality can only be found in those subtle realms beyond this banal physicality.
* Life of a renunciant > life of a king. This place is built for training, not indulgence.
* The more one is able to renounce pleasure the better. 50 years from now after my death, I will surely regret every act of unproductive enjoyment that could have been used to better my existence thereafter.

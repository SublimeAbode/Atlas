* In [[https://suttacentral.net/sn36.6/en/sujato?lang=en][SN 26.6]] the Buddha explains the ordinary escape from pain by delighting in pleasure:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
(Of an unlearned ordinary person) When they’re touched by painful feeling, they resist it. The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that. When touched by painful feeling they *look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures*. Why is that? Because an unlearned ordinary person *doesn’t understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures*. Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that. (Sujato)

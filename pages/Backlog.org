* TODO [#A] Enforce neutrality
** Project Empyrean needs to be absolutely neutral in view
** No a posteriori assertions, only incontestable statements about hypothetical concepts based on information.
** Users can gauge certainty themselves based upon available information. Our job is simply to make the information clear and comprehensible.
** In this way we can avoid all conflicts of view within the organization and much more readily accept contributions of a wide diversity without concern for misrepresentation
** TODO AI arbitration
*** All PRs should be validated with a well tuned LLM to enforce this ideal

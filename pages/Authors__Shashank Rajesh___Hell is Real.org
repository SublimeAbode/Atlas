* Literally or figuratively, hell is real.
* TODO Compile a long list of all the horrific things human beings are forced to endure on this very planet
** Lots and lots of unbelievably horrific content is available online, even just on YouTube.
** This content can serve as a very potent reminder not to be heedless
*** If it can get that bad even just here, imagine what the actual hell realms are like?
*** Some very poignant similes are given in the suttas
*** TODO Collect Buddha analogies about the relative rarity of fortunate existence
**** Dirt under a fingernail compared to all the soil on Earth
** [[Unhappiness]]
